                        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
                        <br>
 
<b>JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development.</b> It was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add <b>dynamic</b> and <b>interactive</b> elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the syntax is more similar to C and is based on <b>ECMAScript</b>, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
<br><br>
JavaScript is a <b>client-side scripting language</b>, which means the source code is processed by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server. 
<br><br>
Like <b>server-side scripting languages</b>, such as <b>PHP</b> and <b>ASP</b>, JavaScript code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage. However, only the output of server-side code is displayed in the HTML, while JavaScript code remains fully visible in the source of the webpage. It can also be referenced in a separate .JS file, which may also be viewed in a browser.
<br><br>
Below is an example of a basic JavaScript function that adds two numbers. The function is called with the parameters 9 and 18. If the code below were included in the HTML of a webpage, it would display the text "27" in an alert box.
<br><br>
                        <center>
                        <img src="../images/script.jpg">
                        </center>
<br>
JavaScript functions can be called within &lt;script&gt; tags or when specific events take place. 
<br><br>
Examples include <b>onClick, onMouseDown, onMouseUp, onKeyDown, onKeyUp, onFocus, onBlur, onSubmit, </b> and many others. 
<br><br>                        
While standard JavaScript is still used for performing basic client-side functions, many web developers now prefer to use JavaScript libraries like <b>jQuery</b> to add more advanced dynamic elements to websites.
